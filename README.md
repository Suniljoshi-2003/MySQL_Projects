1.Database Creation
- retail_db: The main database for storing sales data.
  
2.Table Creation
- retail_sales: Contains sales transaction details such as transaction ID, date, customer ID, category, quantity, price, and total sale.

3.Data Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing or NULL values in key columns like transaction_id, sales_date, customer_ID, etc.
- Deleted rows with NULL values to maintain data integrity.
  
4.Data Exploration
- Explored basic statistics, such as total sales, unique customers, and distinct categories.
- Performed queries to check data completeness and consistency.
  
**SQL Queries and Analysis**

* Data Exploration:

Counted total sales, unique customers, and unique product categories.
Retrieved specific sales data for exploration by transaction date, category, and sales amount.
Data Analysis:

* Analyzed sales data to generate insights such as:

Total sales for each category.
Average age of customers purchasing from the 'Beauty' category.
Top customers based on total sales.
Sales performance for specific months and categories.





# Pizza Sales Data Analysis

**üìå Project Overview**

This project analyzes pizza sales data to extract meaningful insights and calculate key performance indicators (KPIs). The analysis includes total sales, revenue generation, and performance metrics of individual pizzas.

üìÇ Database Information
* Database Name: proj1_db
* Table Name: pizza_sales
* Table Columns: (Provide the main column names for reference, e.g., order_id, pizza_name, quantity, total_price, order_date, order_time)

üß© Key Features
* Total Pizzas Sold: Calculate the total quantity of pizzas sold.
* Total Revenue: Determine the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
* Average Order Value (AOV): Find the average value of an order.
* Top 5 Performing Pizzas: Identify the pizzas with the highest sales quantities.
* Bottom 5 Performing Pizzas: Identify the pizzas with the lowest sales quantities.
* Top 5 Revenue-Generating Pizzas: Find the pizzas that contributed most to revenue.
* Bottom 5 Revenue-Generating Pizzas: Find the pizzas with the least revenue.
* Hourly Sales Distribution: Analyze sales trends by hour.
* Monthly Sales Distribution: Examine sales trends by month.
  

‚öôÔ∏è SQL Queries

The project uses SQL to calculate all KPIs. Here are some examples:

- Total Pizzas Sold:
``` sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_pizzas_sold FROM pizza_sales;
```

- Total Revenue Generated:
``` sql
SELECT ROUND(SUM(total_price)) AS total_revenue_generated FROM pizza_sales;
```

- Top 5 Performing Pizzas:
 ``` sql
SELECT pizza_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_sales 
FROM pizza_sales 
GROUP BY pizza_name 
ORDER BY total_sales DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Database Setup:
- Import the pizza_sales data into a database named proj1_db.

2. SQL Execution:
- Use the provided SQL queries to analyze the data and calculate KPIs.
  
3.Visualization (Optional):
- Use tools like Tableau to visualize the results for better insights.

üìä Insights Generated
Examples of Key Insights:
* Total Pizzas Sold: A clear understanding of sales volume.
* Top Performing Pizzas: Helps identify the best-selling pizza varieties.
* Revenue Insights: Understand which pizzas contribute most to business profitability.
* Sales Trends: Explore when sales peak during the day and throughout the year.

üìà Results Visualization
The analysis results are visualized using Tableau to make the insights more accessible and interactive. Here are the key visualizations created:

1. Total Pizzas Sold:
- A numeric indicator or bar chart to display the total number of pizzas sold.
2. Revenue Trends:
- Line charts showcasing revenue trends over time (daily, monthly).
3. Top Performing Pizzas:
- Horizontal bar charts highlighting the top 5 pizzas based on sales quantity.
4. Hourly Sales Distribution:
- Heatmaps or line charts to analyze pizza sales across different hours of the day.
5. Monthly Sales Distribution:
- Line or area charts showing trends in sales volume month by month.
6. Revenue by Pizza Type:
- Tree maps visualizing revenue contributions of different pizzas.
The Tableau dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance and allow for interactive exploration of data insights.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

SQL: Primary language for data analysis.

Tableau: For visualizing the results and creating interactive dashboards.
