1.Database Creation
- retail_db: The main database for storing sales data.
  
2.Table Creation
- retail_sales: Contains sales transaction details such as transaction ID, date, customer ID, category, quantity, price, and total sale.

3.Data Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing or NULL values in key columns like transaction_id, sales_date, customer_ID, etc.
- Deleted rows with NULL values to maintain data integrity.
  
4.Data Exploration
- Explored basic statistics, such as total sales, unique customers, and distinct categories.
- Performed queries to check data completeness and consistency.
  
**SQL Queries and Analysis**

* Data Exploration:

Counted total sales, unique customers, and unique product categories.
Retrieved specific sales data for exploration by transaction date, category, and sales amount.
Data Analysis:

* Analyzed sales data to generate insights such as:

Total sales for each category.
Average age of customers purchasing from the 'Beauty' category.
Top customers based on total sales.
Sales performance for specific months and categories.
