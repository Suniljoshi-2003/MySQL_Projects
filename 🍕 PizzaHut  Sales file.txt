üçï Pizza Sales Analysis
This repository contains my Pizza Sales Analysis project, where I used SQL to analyze pizza sales data and generate meaningful insights. The project aims to help businesses optimize their sales strategies, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

 üìä Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed pizza sales data to generate key insights, such as:

- Total number of orders placed
- Total revenue generated from pizza sales
- Most popular pizza types and sizes
- Distribution of orders by time and date
- Revenue contribution by each pizza category

üõ† Technologies Used
- SQL for data querying and analysis
- Google Drive for storing the presentation
- GitHub for version control and collaboration

üìÇ Files Included
- SQL Queries: A collection of SQL queries used for data analysis.
- **Project PPT:** [Pizza Sales Analysis Presentation (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yET2F7d_7VhPgUbf4_gSaIaYuxjnOrXK/view?usp=sharing)
  *(This PPT includes a detailed breakdown of the insights and conclusions from the analysis. The file is hosted on Google Drive due to its larger size.)*

üí° Key Insights
- Total Orders & Revenue: Insights on overall sales and revenue generation.
- Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types: A list of the most popular pizzas based on order quantity.
- Most Common Pizza Size Ordered: Data on which pizza size is most frequently chosen by customers.
- Order Distribution by Hour: A breakdown of orders by time of day, identifying peak hours.
- Revenue Contribution by Category: Understanding the financial impact of different pizza categories on total sales.

# Learnings
This project helped me improve my SQL querying skills, understand the real-world applications of data analysis in the food industry, and learn how to present data-driven insights in a clear and actionable way.
